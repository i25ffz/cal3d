    <br>
  <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  The joy of creating a virtual
 character or creature is that the possibilities are limitless on what they
 can do. The exciting thing is that as computers get faster, the more it
is  possible to create and bring to life virtual worlds, full of interacting
people and creatures. As animators, it is our job to animate, or breathe
life into 3D models.<br>
  <br>
    This tutorial assumes that you have a low-polygon model ready for animation. 
 It also assumes that you have a basic knowledge of terminology in computer 
 graphics, and a basic knowledge of 3D Studio Max. For this tutorial, I'm 
using Max 5.1 with Character Studio 4.0. If you are a novice MAX user, I'd 
suggest the tutorials that come with MAX, as they are very well written and 
will give you a basic knowledge of this wonderful program.<br>
  <br>
   First, we've got to go over some basics of what actually goes on when
animating  a character. By knowing these basics, you can then use this tutorial
to fit  your own needs. <br>
  <br>
    For those of you not familiar with Character Studio at all, it is a plug-in 
 that ships with 3DS MAX, which makes the process of rigging a character much
 easier. What's rigging a character you ask? A character is your mesh, or
model that needs to be animated, and before it can be animated, we need to
create a system of hierarchies that act as a skeleton. It is this skeleton 
that we actually animate.<br>
  <br>
    Like in our own bodies, our virtual characters get bones as well, and 
not  only do these bones act as a controlling structure, but also can control 
deformations such as muscle bulge, etc. Character Studio takes Max's already 
great bones system, and simplifies it, making it much faster and easier to 
rig a character. It is possible, and sometimes necessary to combine the Character 
Studio Biped and Max's traditional bones, i.e. a third leg or arm, or perhaps 
a bunch of tentacles, etc.<br>
  <br>
    This brings me to the basics of Character Studio. Character Studio consists 
 of 2 programs within the package: Biped &amp; Physique. Biped is the skeleton 
 structure that will control your character. Physique is the modifier you 
give your character that links it to Biped, thus allowing Biped to have complete 
 control of your character.</font>       <br>

 </big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    All right, now we can finally start setting up our mesh! Load your model 
 into Max: it's time to get started! Okay, I've got my Max with 4 views, which
 is the default mode: Top, Front, Right, &amp; Perspective in the lower right
 corner. Make sure your model is in the center of the workspace, which is
0 for the X and Y axes, and the feet should be at 0 for the Z axis. This way,
when we export to Cal3D, it will work properly. (See figure 1)<br>

    The character I'll be rigging today is Jason (see figure 2), who is one 
of the kids in  an animation I'm currently working on. Because we don't need 
to edit Jason  just yet, we'll select all the pieces that make up Jason's 
arms, head, legs,  feet and shirt.<br>

<i><b>Setting up the Biped</b></i><br>
<br>
Once you have your entire model selected, first hit Alt-X, which turns him 
semi-transparent. After he's transparent, right-click on or around him and 
freeze him! (See figure 3) We'll thaw him out soon enough. We freeze him so
we don't accidentally click on him while we're setting up the Biped. <br>

 </div>
 <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
   Now, click on the Create Tab, and go to the Systems button. Click on the 
 Biped button. (See figure 4) In the front viewport, click and drag from the
bottom of the  feet to the top of the Biped's head. Click on the Motion Tab,
and then select  one of Mr. Bipeds appendages, actually any part of him will
do. Under the  Motion Tab, you'll get a whole gamut of settings and options
will appear.  Click on the little icon that resembles a stick figure. This
will put us in Figure Mode, which allows us to configure Mr. Biped to conform
to our character. Figure Mode is used for rigging our character, as well
as change settings without affecting animation.<br>

 </div>
 <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">   &nbsp;<br>
    Moving right along, you'll see under the initial icons, Track Selection, 
 Copy/Paste, and Structure. If it isn't already visible, click on the Structure 
 rollout. Because Jason isn't a super complex character, many of the&nbsp;
 Biped's settings can remain the same, but here is how I have set him up
for  Jason (see figure 5). Just a few things have changed from the default,
like number of fingers,  links, etc. As you can see, you can give your model
a ponytail, braids, props,  more leg or spine links, and even have forearm 
twist, with as many as 10 links! This provides much more realism when rotating 
the wrist, but for today we'll leave that option unchecked.<br>

 </div>
 <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Now that we've explored the Structure rollout, we need to make the Biped 
 conform to the physiological standards of Jason. In the front viewport, click
 on the triangle-looking thing located at the Biped's pelvis (see figure 6).
This is the Center of Mass, which acts as the base point for all of the Biped.
Select the Center of Mass and position it right at the crotch area of your
model (as in figure 7).<br>

 <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Next, select the right arm &amp; hand, clavicle, and the left leg &amp; 
 foot. Right click and hide these appendages. Now select the Pelvis object 
 and click on the Select &amp; Non-Uniform Scale icon. This is the icon next 
 to the Move icon. If the Uniform Scale button is visible, notice the little 
 arrow at the lower right indicating more tools, so press &amp; hold with 
the left mouse button for a couple of seconds, and you'll get to choose from 
available scaling tools. <br>
<br>
Select the Non-Uniform Scaling Tool <img src="image015.jpg" alt=""
 width="32" height="39">
. Use this to scale the pelvis so that the left leg is roughly in the middle
of Jason's left leg. Then start working your way down his left leg by scaling
length &amp; relative shape. Keep in mind that Character Studio 4's new Biped
is much more skeletal shaped, thus thick bones are not needed. As you are
scaling, make sure to line the knees up, and move the feet into position.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    The spine needs to be a bit bigger as well. Starting with the base of 
the  spine, scale it just a bit, and then go on to the next link, on up to 
the  neck. They should be about the same size, and put the shoulders and neck
in the correct position.</font><br>
<div align="center"><br>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    The Biped's
head needs to be a bit bigger. Using our Non-Uniform scaling  tool, we scale
it to be about the size of Jason's head. You may have to also  scale the
spine a bit as well. Last but not least, scale the arms, hand, and fingers
to match our model. When finished, the left side of your character's biped
object should be closely matched, as in figure 8 below.</font><br>
</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    </font><br>

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Once you've gotten the left side all set up, its time to get the rest
of  the Biped in order. A very nice thing about Character Studio 4 is the
Copy/Paste  rollout. Drag your mouse and select the whole Biped that's visible.
Then,  click on the Copy/Paste rollout, and under that, the Posture button.
Click  on Copy Posture. Now, unhide the rest of the Biped, and hit Paste
Posture  Opposite. This will take all of our changes that we made to the
left side,  and bring them to the right side, thus making the Biped symmetrical.
If you  are satisfied with your Biped, it is a very good idea at this point
to click  on the diskette icon, which will allow us to save our Biped figure
and all  of our presets. Many times I will start animating and forget to
turn off Figure Mode, thus losing my neutral pose. <br>

<i><b>    Applying the physique modifier</b></i><br>
  <br>
</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now it's time to assign
the Physique modifier.</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp; 
  In a viewport, right-click and hit Unfreeze All. Now that Jason is all thawed
 out, click on his feet. For Jason's character, because he has many parts
(i.e. the legs are separate from arms) we will give each part a Physique
 modifier. Click on the Modifier Tab, and it will be under the modifier list.
 You can add it to a custom button by clicking on the little button icon
in  the upper right corner of the Modifier rollout (see figure 10). <br>
<br>

<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><small>Figure 10 : The Physique
modifier rollout</small></b></font><br>
</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  <br>
   Select each part of your model and give each part a physique modifier. 
After assigning Physique, click on the "Link to Root Node" button <img
 src="image022.jpg" alt="" width="30" height="30">
, and then clicking on the Center of Mass for the Biped. When you do this,
a window will appear which allows you to preset how Physique sets up its
influences. For this tutorial, we'll just leave it as default. It really
doesn't matter what order  you apply physique, but if you have many, many
parts to a model it's good to do it in some sort of order, so you remember
which piece does and does not have the physique modifier.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Now that they all have Physique applied, if you have multiple meshes
in  your character, like Jason does, click on the legs mesh. You will notice
 that it has many sub-objects similar to your editable mesh or poly that
you're  working with. Of all the sub-objects available, we will only be focusing
on the envelope and vertex sub-objects. The envelope sub-object allows for
editing of envelopes, which determine which bone affects which vertices.
When you click on the Envelope sub-object, you'll notice lines drawn through
your mesh, corresponding to the Biped. These are called Links. If you select
a link, you'll notice a balloon-shaped thing that surrounds the link. You'll
 also notice the vertices that it encompasses or is near to are shaded. These
 are the vertices that will be influenced by that link, and in turn, that
particular bone. You can have multiple bones affect a single vertex, and
sometimes you want that, and sometimes it can be a pain in the ass. <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Okay, now go to the Vertex Sub-Object mode. You'll see three colored
crosses.  The Red indicates deformable vertices, the Green: Rigid, and the
Blue indicates  that they aren't influenced at all by a bone, or Root vertices.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Next, get out of sub-object mode and click the Biped's left foot and
go  to your Motion Tab. Unclick the Figure Mode button and move the Biped's
foot  to <b>his</b> left. You'll notice that some vertices from the right
leg might be dragged along and some from the left leg might be left behind
(see figure 11). Now click on the Key Info rollout and click Create Key.
This will create a key at frame 0 so we can see what vertex weights need
to be edited.<br>

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    &nbsp;<br>
    Going back to Physique, first go into Envelopes sub-object mode and click 
 on the L Thigh link, bringing up its envelope. Looks like it needs to be 
a bit bigger. Using the Radial Scale spinner, increase the envelopes overall 
 scale and watch as the rest of our leg is influenced. The problem that we 
 have now is that parts of the other leg are influenced by this larger envelope. 
 Don't worry about that for now and work your way down the leg, increasing 
 or decreasing the envelopes to encompass your mesh. Once you have the left 
 leg envelopes done, do the same to the right leg (<b>his</b> right, not yours).
Now, if the bones were placed properly and the envelopes aren't too big or
too small, your envelopes won't influence the wrong leg. If your envelopes
 DO influence the wrong leg, after you've sized each envelope, go into the
 Vertex sub-object mode. Make sure the select button is pressed, and select
 the problem vertices. If they are from the left leg, and are influenced
by  the right leg, click on Remove from Link and select the right thigh and
calf  links. This will remove those links from influencing those vertices.

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Now we repeat this process to locate other naughty vertices.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Okay, the head is a bit different, as you don't want it to deform as
you  move the head, so select all the vertices above the neck and remove
the neck  links influence from them first. Next, we want to assign a Rigid
influence  on them to the Head link so click on Assign to Link. Now, remember
the three  colored cross buttons? Right now, the red should be depressed.
Depress the  Green instead, which means that any link we then select, it
assigns a rigid  influence over, so it doesn't deform. This is very useful
if you have a robot  with hard metal or armor on a character that you dont
want stretching or deforming.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Now repeat this process if there are other Rigid objects in your character.
 <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    After you've edited all the vertex link assignments, it is a good idea
 to Lock the assignments, and if further editing is required, once the vertices 
 are locked, you can type in their weights for precise control. This can be
helpful around the underarm and anywhere else that just seems to be influenced
 improperly. Keep in mind that you can't change link assignments unless the
 selected vertices are Unlocked.<br>
  <br>
  Rigging can be the longest and worst part of character animation, and you'll 
 be glad once it's over. The biggest thing to remember is to do it right the
 first time, and take the time to rig your character well, otherwise animating
 him can give you much more grief.&nbsp; </font>             <br>

  <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  Finally done with rigging!
Now  let's create a simple walking animation.<br>
<br>
</font>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img

<br>
<small><b>Figure 13 : Walking animation keyframes</b></small></font><br>
</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  <br>
  To begin, click on a part of the Biped again and go into the Motion tab.
 What we'll be making is a simple walk cycle, and we won't be using Character
 Studio's popular Footstep mode either. <br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Some Basics of Animation</i></b><br>
  <br>
    Traditional cell animation is usually accomplished by artists drawing 
the  Keyframes first, and then later filling in with the In-Betweens. For 
example,  on frame 1, a character is standing, then on frame 8, he's in the 
air, and  by frame 20 he's on the side of a building. These would be the keyframes,
 and the poses that make up his actions between these frames would be, yes
 you got it, the In-Betweens. The way you work in MAX is a bit different, 
but very similar. First, put your initial poses and keyframe in the large 
poses until you've got your animation. Then come back in and tweak the poses 
in-between each frame so that your character acts and behaves smoothly. <br>
  <br>
    For our walk cycle, make sure you have your character physiqued, then 
if  you want you can hide your mesh and just work with the bones. This helps 
if your computer isn't fast or you have many polygons or large textures. Sometimes
 I like to keep the mesh visible so I can see how it reacts to certain poses.<br>
  <br>
    Now to start animating Jason. Click on the Time Configuration dialog
box  (see figure 14) and make the starting frame 1 and the ending frame 32.
This is an even number,  which makes it easy for keyframing. I set the first
keyframe to 1 because  we want the animation to loop evenly, which it must
be one keyframe less,  so it sets back up for the first one in the sequence.
<br>

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Using the rotate and the move commands, position your Biped in an extended 
 stride position. In figure 15, I have set the right foot and the left arm
 forward, and the left foot and right arm back. <br>
<br>

    Here's where observation of people and their movements is critical. If
 you look at someone walk, you'll notice that not just their legs and arms
 move, but the spine, hips, and shoulders as well, even if the walk is basic, 
 like the one we're making.<br>
  <br>
    Select the pelvis. Since his right leg is the one taking the step, all
 the weight will be placed upon the right foot, so in the front viewport,
rotate the pelvis just a tad so the right foot is lower than the left (see
figure 16).<br>
  <br>
</font>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    The Spine also moves to compensate for weight distribution. Click on
the  Spine bone, and while holding CTRL, select Spine 1, Spine 2, and Spine
3.  Rotate these in the opposite direction of the pelvis, so they curve just 
slightly to the left of the character (as in figure 17).<br>
  <br>

</div>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    Now, you'll also notice when someone walks, the pelvis, spine and shoulders 
 also rotate just a bit around the Z-Axis, i.e. when the left arm is forward, 
 they are rotated from left to right. Don't overdo this rotation.<br>
  <br>
    Simple practice and observation of people walking and their movements 
will allow you to make better, more realistic movements.<br>
  <br>
   In the motion tab, still with part of the Biped selected, add a keyframe 
 under the Key Info rollout. Still in the motion tab, go to the Copy/Paste 
 rollout and this time click the Pose button and copy your pose. Now, drag
 the timeslider to frame 32. Click Paste Pose, and add another keyframe.
Next,  go to frame 16 and Paste Pose Opposite. If you decide to play this
animation,  you'll see your character sliding along the ground, as if he's
on ice. <br>
  <br>
    Now go to frame 8, which is half-way between the first frame and frame
 16, where we'll put our In-Between keyframe. Since he's taking a step, we'll
 just move his foot up just a tad, but not too much. Usually people don't
bend their knees too much when walking casually. Don't forget to assign a
keyframe at frame 8. Still on frame 8, copy our pose and go to frame 24 and
Paste Pose Opposite. Now we have a character that is starting to look like
he's walking!<br>

    This was just a very basic walk cycle. It's up to you to add personality 
 to your character. There are many books and resources available showing movements
 and talking about timing that can help you in your quest to be a great animator.

  <br>
    &nbsp;<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
    One of the most important parts of Cal3D is the MAX plug-in that allows
 artists to export their animated characters to a format that the programmers
 can use. Using the exporter correctly requires a lot of attention to detail,
 so listen up!<br>
  <br>
    Before we export our model, we need to make our textures according to 
what  Cal3D likes. Each material on your character MUST have a slot in the 
material  editor, and these materials must be named properly with a number 
or Tag starting  with 0. Example:<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Pants [0]<br>
    Shirt [1]<br>
    Face [2]<br>
    Arms [3]<br>
    Shoes [4]<br>
  <br>
   Now we are ready to export the model using Cal3D's exporters. The latest
 exporters can be found at <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cal3d">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cal3d</a>.
 It is important to export the SKELETON FIRST. Make sure that the Biped is
 in FIGURE MODE, and select his Center of Mass. Under the file menu, click
 Export. Now select the Cal3D skeleton exporter, and type a name for your
skeleton. A dialog box will appear with all of the bones in your Biped checked.
Just hit next and finish, and you've got your Cal3D skeleton!<br>
  <br>
    After the skeleton is exported, you can export your materials, meshes 
and  animations in any order you want. When exporting your mesh objects or 
your  animation, the dialog box will ask you for a skeleton, which if you 
hit browse,  you'll see the skeleton file you just created. When exporting 
the animation file, make sure your Biped is NOT in figure mode. You will then
be given the choice of FPS and the selection of keys to export. Also, if
you change your material at all, you have to re-export it AND the mesh again,
as that tag is saved in both the mesh and the material's Cal3D file.<br>
  <br>
    A bit about Cal3D's Spring system. When exporting your mesh, you are
given  the option to enable the cloth spring system. Before you do this,
make sure  your mesh is set up properly, or MAX will crash. First, make sure
every polygon  in the mesh has the same smoothing group. I've also heard
that there can only be one material applied to the mesh. Now assign a weight
to the vertices,  with 0.0 being your rigid vertices, and anything greater
than 0.0 will give  those vertices a cloth-like property, with the higher
number being more springy.  Now just export the mesh and enable the spring
system check.<br>
  <br>
    After everything is exported, create a .cfg file that contains all the
 information about the files that make up your character. This can be created
 using any text editor. When writing the list of included materials, it MUST
 be done so that the material tagged with [0] appears FIRST in the list,
with  the second being [1], etc. I've found it's easier just to name my exported 
 materials with tags as well, so I know in what order to place them. <br>
  <br>
    Knowing all this about exporting, here is a sample .cfg:</font>

    On the Cal3D website, you can download a mini-viewer that is used to
view  and test your models. All you have to do is drag your .cfg file over
Cal3d_miniviewer.exe  and it will run your model. You can also run it manually
on the command line by typing in Cal3d_miniviewer.exe whatever.cfg, with
the name of your cfg file replacing whatever.cfg.<br>

    I've taken you through the steps of rigging a character, animating him, 
 and then exporting him, and now it's your turn to start creating characters 
 and giving them life. Have fun with it, and always observe people and their 
 movements! Also, in movies, it can be fun to &nbsp;slow down the motion, 
and visually take note where the weight distribution is and the timing of 
everything. This can be really fun during action sequences, such as the many 
in The Matrix, or Lord of the Rings. </font>  <br>
