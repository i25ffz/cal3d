    <title>What is Cal3D?</title>
    <para>
      Cal3D is a free skeletal-based 3d character animation library written
      in C++ in a platform-/graphic API-independent way.
    </para>
    <para>
      Originally designed to be used in a 3d client for
      <ulink url="http://www.worldforge.org">WorldForge</ulink>, it evolved
      into a stand-alone library which can be used in many different kinds
      of projects.

      movement and provides this library without any additional restrictions.
      However, to make this a "fair deal" and to support the future development of
      the library, we invite you to follow these points when using the Cal3D library
      in your projects:
